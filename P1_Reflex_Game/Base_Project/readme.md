# [Project 1 - Reflex Game][1] 
This project involves creating a game in which two players compete to press a button as soon as they see an LED light up. Girls will construct a circuit composed of an LED and two (or more) push buttons. Then, girls will write Python code to illuminate the LED after a random amount of time and record which button is pressed soonest. Advanced students can write additional code to assign names to each button, add multiple colors to the LED (using RGB LED), a create a points system for the game. 

Concepts:

* Circuit construction
  * LEDs
  * Tactile buttons
* Python coding
  * GPIO integration
  * Random numbers
  * Accepting user input


Materials Needed:

* 1 LED
* 2 tactle push buttons
* 2 Male-to-Male jumper wires
* 2 Male-to-Female jumper wires
