# [Project 5 - Random Compliment Generator][1] 
This workshop guides girls through coding a compliment generator using random numbers. Girls will learn how to interact with CSV files in Python, and how to implement a GUI (graphical user interface).


Concepts:
* Python coding
  * File I/O
  * Using guizero library


## Installing guizero
The GUI in this project uses a library called `guizero`. To install this library, use the command below:
```
pip install guizero
```
This command assumes you're using Python3 for this project. To check your version of Python, run this command in a terminal window.
```
python --version
```
If the version number is 2.X, you may want to switch to using Python3. If you're using one of our pis, you probably already have it installed. Create an alias for python3 by running this command in a terminal window.
```
alias python python3
```
