# Girlcode Raspberry Pi Workshop Series
## KU Women in Computing
Repository for code related to KUWIC's Girlcode Raspberry Pi Workshops - held at KU's LEEP2 Engineering complex

### [Project 1 - Reflex Game][1] 
This project involves creating a game in which two players compete to press a button as soon as they see an LED light up. Girls will construct a circuit composed of an LED and two (or more) push buttons. Then, girls will write Python code to illuminate the LED after a random amount of time and record which button is pressed soonest. Advanced students can write additional code to assign names to each button, add multiple colors to the LED (using RGB LED), a create a points system for the game. 


### [Project 2 - Stop Motion Animation][2] 
This project involves creating stop-motion animation videos using still frames captured when a button is pushed. Girls will connect a camera to their pi and then use the terminal to learn the basic ways to interact with it. Then, girls will write Python code to take photos when buttons are pressed and save them to memory with unique file names using while loops and counters. Finally, girls will use the command line to compile their still frames into a video.  


### [Project 3 - Motion Activated Security Device][3] 
This project involves creating a “security” device to begin recording video when motion is detected. Girls will connect both a PIR motion sensor and a camera to their pi. The terminal will be used to learn the basics of these components. Then, the girls will write Python code to being capturing video when the PIR sensor detects motion, and write this video to memory.


### [Project 4 - Ultrasonic Theremin][4] 
This workshop leads girls through creating a theremin, which is an instrument controlled by the position of the musician’s hands relative to a distance sensor. Girls will connect an ultrasonic distance sensor to their pi, then write some Python code to detect the distances around it and send the pitch information to Sonic Pi. 


### [Project 5 - Random Compliment Generator][5] 
This workshop guides girls through coding a compliment generator using random numbers. Girls will learn how to interact with CSV files in Python, and how to implement a GUI (graphical user interface).


### [Project 6 - Silly Thoughts Twitter Bot][6] 
This workshop guides girls through coding a Twitter bot to post silly, random, computer-generated sentences. Girls will use Python code and Twitter development tools to interact with their Twitter bot. No prior experience necessary!

### Project 7 - Mini Piano 
This workshop guides girls through coding and wiring a mini piano.
