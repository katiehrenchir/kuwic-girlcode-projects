# [Project 4 - Ultrasonic Theremin][1] 
This project involves creating a theremin (an instrument controlled by the position of the musicianâ€™s hands relative to a distance sensor). Girls will connect an ultrasonic distance sensor to a pi, then write some Python code to detect the distances around it. Next, girls will use Sonic Pi to emit noise. Finally the girls will use message passing (this is quite advanced!) to send pitch information (a function of the distance information) from their Python code to Sonic Pi.

Here's a very cool video of a theremin in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6KbEnGnymk&feature=youtu.be&t=18

Concepts:
* Circuit construction
  * Ultrasonic distance sensor
  * Resistors and strength differences
* Python coding
  * Distance sensor libraries
  * Message passing: sending
* Ruby coding (Sonic Pi)
  * Live loops
  * Message passing: receiving


Materials Needed:
* Ultrasonic distance sensor
* 330 Ohm resistor
* 470 Ohm resistor
* 3+ Male-to-Male jumper wires
* 4+ Male-to-Female jumper wires

## Installing pythonosc
The message passing functions of the python script use a library called 'pythonosc'. To install this library, run the following command in a terminal window.
```
pip3 install python-osc
```
This command assumes you're using Python3 for this project. To check your version of Python, run this command in a terminal window.
```
python --version
```
If the version number is 2.X, you may want to switch to using Python3. If you're using one of our pis, you probably already have it installed. Create an alias for python3 by running this command in a terminal window.
```
alias python python3
```

## Using the headphone jack
If you want to connect a sound source to your program using the 3.5mm headphone jack, be sure to enable it on your pi. Run the following command in a terminal window.
``` 
sudo raspi-config
```
Arrow down to `Advanced Options`, then select `Audio`, and finally, force the use of the 3.5mm jack. Finish and exit. If your Sonic Pi session is already running, close and reopen it. 


## Circuit Diagram for Connecting Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
Be careful when wiring up your circuit, and observe the orientation of the Distance Sensor. Do not flip the sensor backwards - this will swap your power and ground wires and could damage the sensor.
