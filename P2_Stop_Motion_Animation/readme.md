# [Project 2 - Stop Motion Animation][1] 
This project involves creating stop-motion animation videos using still frames captured when a button is pushed. Girls will connect a camera to their pi and then use the terminal to learn the basic ways to interact with it. Then, girls will write Python code to take photos when buttons are pressed and save them to memory with unique file names using while loops and counters. Finally, girls will use the command line to compile their still frames into a video.  
Concepts:

* Circuit construction
  * PiCamera module
  * Tactile button
* Terminal Commands
  * Interact with raspistill via the terminal
  * Compile still images into video
* Python coding
  * PiCamera interaction
  * GPIO button integration
  * Try/Except exception catching
  * While loops


Materials Needed:

* 1 tactle push button
* 2 Male-to-Female jumper wires
